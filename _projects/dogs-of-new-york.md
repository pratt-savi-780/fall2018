tagline: "\"Dogs of New York\" examines publicly available data from New York City's Open Data Portal detailing all dog licenses filed in the year 2016. The two maps created for the project were built for two courses at Pratt Institute, \"Foundations of Spatial Thinking\" and \"Introduction to Interactive Web Programming\" respectively, and then displayed side-by-side in one cohesive web page. Attempting the same goal in each class the skills learned in each was valuable in exposing the benefits and challenges of respective GIS tools across the field of web mapping as a whole."
