The target audience is artists and people in arts-related fields throughout the five boroughs and beyond who would like a comprehensive, visual, one-stop map of all the non-profit galleries and museums in the New York City area. Rather than pecking through google maps (or similar), the user can quickly see the institutions relationship to one another and plan trips via public transportation to either an individual destination or closely clustered galleries and museums.
