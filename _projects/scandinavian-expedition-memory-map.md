In August 2018 I went on a 13-day backpacking expedition in the Arctic Circle in Norway and Sweden with 9 other people. During that time I only had analogue recording devices (pen and paper), and a paper map used for navigating and campsite locating. It was an awesome experience, and I wanted to create an interactive map to share it. 

My data source was the map with hiking routes and campsites marked. I digitized these by recording the UTM coordinates and converting them to Latitude and Longitude. I also used QGIS to create polylines between the points that reflected our hiking route. 

Most of my emphasis was in creating a storytelling interaction that included photos, animated drawings, and text, that were connected to certain locations. I used Jack Dougherty's Leaflet-Storymap as a framework for my scroll interaction, which was super helpful to me as a novice coder.
